# OpenIAM Control File Example 31a
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the AoR plot type. To use the AoR plot,
# you must have OpenWellbores distributed across the area of interest.
# There are multiple ways of doing that, and this example uses the 'range' option.
# The OpenWellbore component illustrates setup of the 'range' option, which
# contains 'xmin', 'xmax', 'dx', 'ymin', 'ymax', and 'dy'. Number of wellbores is
# calculated from the number of points made with the 'range' option.
# The placed OpenWellbores are hypothetical and only used to assess the aquifer contamination
# that could happen if a leakage pathway was present. The spatial extent of such
# impacts is meant to inform the definition of an Area of Review (AoR). Note that
# while pressure and CO2saturation results from reservoirs can be displayed in an
# AoR plot, these results show the conditions within the reservoir rather than
# aquifer impacts. The OpenWellbore components are placed with the 'grid' option,
# which contains 'xmin', 'xmax', 'xsize', 'ymin', 'ymax', and 'ysize'.
#
# Note that having 'GenerateOutputFiles': False and 'GenerateCombOutputFile': False
# within the ModelParams section will prevent the creation of individual output
# and combined outputs files. The combined outputs files can be large
# due to the number of components used. In this example there is one
# SimpleReservoir, OpenWellbore, and FutureGen2Aquifer created for each
# x and y value specified with the 'grid' option, and an output file
# would be created for each conmponent. Additionally, the AoR plot type creates
# a csv file with the data used for the plot, and this csv file is much smaller
# than the combined and individual output files.
#
# Both wellTop (in the OpenWellbore component) and depth (within
# the FutureGen2Aquifer component) should reflect the depth to the
# bottom of the aquifer being examined for the AoR (here, aquifer 2).
#
# Note that the PlotInjectionSites, FigureDPI, and SaveCSVFiles entires for
# the AoR plots are optional. If those entries are left out, the figure
# will use the default settings where injection sites are not plotted
# (PlotInjectionSites: False), the figure dots-per-inch (dpi) is 100
# (FigureDPI: 100), and .csv files are saved (SaveCSVFiles: True). To
# demonstrate that these entries are optional, they have all been excluded
# from the AoR plot of CO2saturation. When using a LookupTableReservoir,
# the injection site will only be plotted if InjectionCoordx and InjectionCoordy
# entries are also provided. See Control File example 32a.
