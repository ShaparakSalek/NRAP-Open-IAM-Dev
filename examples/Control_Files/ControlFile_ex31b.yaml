# OpenIAM Control File Example 31b
#
# This example is similar to example 31a, but it includes a
# GenericAquifer instead of a FutureGen2Aquifer. The AoR plot
# type can be used with: pressure and CO2saturation results from reservoir
# components; pH_volume and TDS_volume results from aquifer components like
# FutureGen2Aquifer, FutureGen2AZMI, and DeepAlluviumAquifer; and
# Dissolved_CO2_volume and Dissolved_salt_volume results from GenericAquifer
# components. Model run times can be longer when using GenericAquifers
# instead of FutureGen2Aquifers, so the number of hypothetical OpenWellbores
# (wellbores used to consider the leakage that could happen if a pathway was present
# - and what the Area of Review should be) has been decreased here from 196
# (14 by 14) to 49 (7 by 7).
#
# A GenericAquifer component is made for each OpenWellbore location. With
# this arrangement (7 by 7, an odd number of rows and columns but with the
# maximum distances on either side of the injection well being equal), however, an
# OpenWellbore will be placed on the injection site itself. These conditions
# cause the pressure results at that OpenWellbore to go to infinity. Regardless,
# the OpenWellbore is hypothetical and the AoR plot code is set up to exclude
# such a result. The simulation will print warning statements during the model 
# run, but the simulation will finish and the infinite pressures will be excluded 
# from the AoR plots.
#
# Additionally, this example shows how to set the critical pressure of an OpenWellbore 
# component to a specific value. This example uses the same stratigraphy from example 
# 31a, and with the brineDensity value used in that example (1075 kg/(m^3)) the 
# calculated critical pressure is 23.2 MPa. Instead of using that calculated critical 
# pressure, this example enforces a higher critical pressure of 23.8 MPa. To enforce a 
# critical pressure, set both 'critPressureApproach' and 'enforceCritPressure' to True 
# (these entries are under 'Controls'). Then provide the 'critPressure' parameter under 
# the 'Parameters' section. With the higher critical pressure used here, the critical 
# pressure is only exceeded is a ~5 km radius near the injection site (rather than all 
# pressures exceeding the critical pressure).
#
# Setting the critical pressure for the OpenWellbore component does not automatically 
# change the critical pressure used in the AoR plot examining reservoir pressures, 
# however. An AoR plot that examines reservoir pressures only examines output from the
# reservoir component. To maintain a uniform treatment of critical pressure, the critical 
# pressure used in the AoR plot can be specified with the 'CriticalPressureMPa' entry 
# under the plot name (under Plot1, 'CriticalPressureMPa: 23.8' for 23.8 MPa).
