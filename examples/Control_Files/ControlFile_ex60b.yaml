# OpenIAM Control File Example ex60b
#
# This example is similar to control file example 60a, but this example reads all 
# values for the Bowtie plot from pre-made .csv files. No components are included 
# in the Components list under ModelParams. The files used here (contained in 
# examples/Control_Files/input_data/ex60b/) were produced by example 60a. Because 
# multiple well locations were used in example 60a, the 'ComponentNameList' and 'FileName' 
# entries in the input files have multiple entries. For example, the 'ComponentNameList' 
# entry for the 'Brine Leakage into the Thief Zone' risk is 'MSW1_000, MSW1_001'. These 
# names correspond with the first ('_000') and second ('_001') well locations provided 
# in example 60a ((x, y) values of (37478.0 m, 48333.0 m) and (37555.0 m, 48999.0 m)).
# The 'FileName' entry is 'MSW1_000.brine_aquifer1.csv, MSW1_001.brine_aquifer1.csv'. 
# Here, a comma is used to separate the different items in each entry. More locations 
# can be included by adding more to the 'ComponentNameList' and 'FileName' entries.
#
# The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that the Bowtie plot can be run by 
# itself. A simulation can take a long time - if the user wants to change the Bowtie 
# plot, running the whole simulation again can be unnecessary. Even without the 
# components defined here, the control file should still be include a stratigraphy 
# component (the 'Stratigraphy' section below).
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../src/openiam/components/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex60b.yaml
