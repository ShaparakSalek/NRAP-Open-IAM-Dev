# OpenIAM Control File Example ex59c
#
# This example is similar to control file example 59a, but it sets the values for certain
# Bowtie whiskers using pre-made .csv files. The Bowtie plot type is meant to be flexible 
# and capable of representing different kinds of risks. A whisker on the Bowtie figure
# could represent, for example, the risk that the injection operation could activate a 
# fault. Because NRAP-Open-IAM does not currently have components to simulate that behavior, 
# the required results could be taken from another software product (e.g., Operational 
# Forecasting of Induced Seismicity, ORION) and set up for use in the Bowtie plot created 
# by NRAP-Open-IAM. When reading pre-made files into a Bowtie plot, the 'Contributors' or
# 'Consequences' .csv files (here, located in examples/Control_Files/input_data/ex59c) 
# should include the following columns: 'ReadResults', 'FileDirectory', 'FileName', 
# 'Analysis', 'Realizations', and 'Units'.
#
# The 'ReadResults' column specifies whether the results for each field are read from
# pre-made files. Enter values of 1 and 0 for yes and no, respectively. For any rows that 
# are to have values read from pre-made files, the path to the file is entered under 
# 'FileDirectory'. The name of the file is entered under 'FileName'. In this example, the 
# 'Consequences.csv' file includes a field for the metric 'Cost ($)'. The 'ComponentNameList'
# entry for this field is 'CostModel', and the 'Label' is 'Cost of Remedial Response Plans'. 
# Note that the 'CostModel' referred to here is not a real model; the data used here were 
# created just for this example. The 'Analysis' entry specifies whether the data are from a 
# deterministic simulation ('forward') or a stochastic simulation ('lhs' or 'parstudy'). This 
# input informs the code how the pre-made .csv files will be formatted. If the 'Analysis' is set
# to 'forward', then two columns will be expected in the pre-made file: one column for time 
# (labeled as 'Time (days)') and one column for the values over time. The label for the values 
# (i.e., entry in the first row in the column containing the values) should be the component 
# name, a period, and the metric name (e.g., 'CostModel.Cost'). If the 'Analysis' field specifies 
# that the results come from a stochastic simulation, then the number of realizaztions for that 
# field can be specified under the 'Realizations' field. In this case, the pre-made files are expected
# expected to contain columns for 'Time (days)' and 'Realization 0' through 'Realization N-1', 
# where N is the total number of realizations.
#
# In order to have stochastic simulation results from another program align with those from 
# NRAP-Open-IAM, it is possible to take the output files saved by NRAP-Open-IAM (enabled by having 
# 'GenerateOutputFiles' as 'True' under 'ModelParams') and use them as input to the model generating 
# the results entered through pre-made files. That possibility would depend on the capabilities of the 
# model being used, however. In this example, the costs entered in the CostModel.Cost.csv file were made 
# to scale with the size of TDS plume volumes saved by simulation 59a. In fact, almost all of the 
# output shown in the Bowtie figure made by this example come from .csv files produced by a control file 
# example with this setup (59a or 59c). The setup of the simulation used was the same, but the results 
# will be slightly different from due to the differences in parameter value sampling in stochastic 
# simulations. Only the whisker for 'CO2 Released into the Atmosphere' is made to use the results from 
# this example ('ReadResults' is entered as 0 for that field). The .csv file containing the CO2_atm 
# output needed for that field are contained in the directory used (examples/Control_Files/input_data/ex59c), 
# however, so that field could also be based on pre-made results by setting 'ReadResults' to 1.
#
# The Bowtie plot type also allows the user to specify the units for the values contained in the files - this 
# input is provided through the 'Units' column in the 'Contributors' and 'Consequences' input files. If the 
# metric type used is recognized by NRAP-Open-IAM, then the 'Units' column can be entered as 'None'. The 
# correct units will be automatically recognized. Because 'Cost' is not an output type in NRAP-Open-IAM, the 
# 'Cost of Remedial Response Plans' field is given a 'Unit' entry of '$'.
#
# When importing results into a Bowtie plot, the user can also specify the analysis type for those results. For 
# example, the NRAP-Open-IAM results might be stochastic (LHS analysis) but it is possible that another model 
# used might be unable to perform a similar stochastic analysis. In this example, one of the 'Consequences' 
# fields used is labeled 'Financial Penalties'. The 'Penalty' metric contained in the file 'CostModel.Penalty.csv' 
# was made up for this example. Importantly, the metric was made to have only one realization and 'Analysis' field 
# for that metric is set to 'forward' in the 'Consequences.csv' input file. Any metrics imported into a Bowtie plot 
# should still align with the times used in the model, however (i.e., one value entered for every time step, starting 
# from 0 and extending to EndTime). If the user only wanted to display a single value, then that value should be 
# repeated for every time step. If the metric has a forward (determinsitic) analysis type, then the column for that 
# metric should be labeled as ComponentName.Metric (e.g., 'CostModel.Penalty').
#
# If a field uses values taken directly from NRAP-Open-IAM, then the following fields should be entered as 
# 'None': 'FileDirectory', 'FileName', 'Analysis', 'Realizations', and 'Units'. The 'ReadResults' field should 
# be entered as 0.
#
