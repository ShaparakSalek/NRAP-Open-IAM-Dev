# OpenIAM Control File Example 51b
#
# This example illustrates a system model with an analytical reservoir component 
# providing pressure and CO2 saturation inputs for a Multisegmented Wellbore AI component. 
# The Multisegmented Wellbore AI component is a machine learning model with a robust 
# performance. It's conceptualization is similar to the Multisegmented Wellbore component, but 
# the Multisegmented Wellbore component is an analytical model.
#
# This example uses four wellbore locations. Two are entered with specific x and y coordinates 
# (under 'Locations'), while two are generated within a specified domain (under 'RandomLocDomain'). 
# The specified locations will be the first two locations (component names ending with '_000' and '001'), 
# while the random locations will be the last two locations (component names ending with '_002' and '_003').
# In the TimeSeries plots provided, the component names are entered under 'Subplot' - the subplot title 
# for each location are specified with the component names.
#
# Because this model uses 4 wellbore locations and using the machine learning models is computationally 
# demanding, the useDLmodel parameter is set to 0. The Multisegmented Wellbore AI results are therefore 
# derived from analytical modeling.
#
# To run this example, one of the files for the Multisegmented Wellbore AI component must be 
# downloaded. The files are not included in the download of NRAP-Open-IAM because they are 
# large. The two files can be downloaded from these links:
#     http://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/42fb2930-7bf5-48d9-821b-d801c6f29f36/resource/42882a99-a5b0-4d68-8f4c-cad4812358c4/download
#     http://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/42fb2930-7bf5-48d9-821b-d801c6f29f36/resource/8b786e28-0e52-40d4-84b5-23c25dc2d338/download
#
# Because useDLmodel is set to 0 here, only the file from the first link is required (about 2 GB). Although  
# the results are based on analytical modeling in this case, the file is still required to calculate 
# fluid properties. The second file (about 5.2 GB) is required if useDLmodel is set to 1.
#
# The zipped file must then be unzipped, with the resulting folder placed into this directory:
#     src/openiam/components/models/wellbore/multisegmented_ai
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#  python ../../src/openiam/components/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex51a.yaml
