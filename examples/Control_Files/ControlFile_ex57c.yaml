# OpenIAM Control File Example 57c
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the TTFD Workflow. The setup of the
# simulation is similar to Control File Example 41. This example is
# different, however, because the analysis only focuses on aquifer 2
# (AquiferName: aquifer2). The TTFD Workflow can only consider one aquifer
# at a time, but example 41 has two sets of OpenWellbore and GenericAquifer
# components for aquifers 1 and 2. The same results could be obtained by
# running this example twice, however, once with AquiferName: aquifer1 and
# once with AquiferName: aquifer2. The results would be saved in .csv files
# (if SaveCSVFiles is left at the default option of True), and these files
# could be used to compile a combined dataset of the plume timings in
# aquifers 1 and 2.
#
# Despite such issues, the setup of a Workflow is meant to prevent common
# errors that could occur when using a standard control file (e.g., having
# a typo in a component's name in a 'Connection' entry or failing to have
# the correct output types included). The TTFD Workflow automatically sets
# up (1) the connections between reservoir, wellbore, and aquifer components,
# (2) the correct output types for the analysis being conducted (e.g.,
# including Dissolved_salt_dr and Dissolved_salt_dz when assessing Dissolved
# salt plumes), and (3) the TTFD plot entry itself. Slight formatting or
# spelling errors in such efforts could cause the simulation to fail, and
# the TTFD Workflow is meant to prevent such issues.
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex57c.yaml
