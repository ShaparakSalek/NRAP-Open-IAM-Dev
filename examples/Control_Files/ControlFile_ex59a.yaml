# OpenIAM Control File Example ex59a
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the Bowtie plot type. Here, the name of the 
# Bowtie plot is 'Bowtie_Figure', which is entered under the 'Plots' section. This 
# figure is then specified as a Bowtie plot by having 'Bowtie' indented under the 
# plot name. Different options for the Bowtie plot are then entered under 'Bowtie'.
#
# The Bowtie plot is meant to aid in risk assessment. Specifically, it considers the 
# factors that could contribute to a top event risk (i.e., worst-case scneario at the 
# site). The top event considered here is 'Unwanted Fluid Migration from the Reservoir', 
# which is entered with the 'TopEventLabel' entry under 'Bowtie'. A Bowtie figure has 
# lines or 'whiskers' extending to the left and right of the top event label at the 
# center of the figure. The whiskers extending to the left represent the contributing 
# factors (e.g., unwanted fluid migration could occur due to leakage along a legacy well). 
# The whiskers extending to the right represent the potential consequences of the top 
# event (e.g., ground water is contaminated, CO2 is released to the atmosphere, and 
# the project loses support). The input for these whiskers are provided with .csv files. 
# The paths to the files are entered with the 'Contributors' and 'Consequences' entries 
# under 'Bowtie'. In this example, each file has the following columns: 'Index', 
# 'ComponentNameList', 'Metrics', 'Threshold', and 'Label'. Each row represents one of the 
# whiskers, where the 'Label' input is the text shown for that whisker. For example, 
# one of the 'Contributors' whiskers is labeled 'Brine Leakage Along a Legacy Well'. The 
# legacy well referred to here is the well represented by the OpenWellbore1 component.
# The 'ComponentNameList' comlumn specifies which component is to be used for the whisker's 
# results. The 'Brine Leakage Along a Legacy Well' whisker has 'OpenWellbore1' entered for 
# the 'ComponentNameList' column. The 'Metric' column specifies the output type to use; the 
# brine leakage column has 'brine_aquifer' entered for the 'Metric' column. Note that 
# this output type must be produced by the corresponding component. The 'Threshold' column 
# specifies the threshold used to assess the metric. The Bowtie figure will show a probability 
# value for each whisker; this probability is the fraction of realizations in which the metric 
# was greater than or equal to the corresponding threshold. If the analysis type is forward 
# (a deterministic simulation), then the probabilities will always be either 0 % or 100 %.
# One of the other contributor whiskers is labelled 'CO2 Leakage Along a Legacy Well', with 
# the corresponding metric being 'CO2_aquifer'. The 'Consequences' whiskers include 
# 'CO2 Released Into the Atmosphere', 'TDS Plumes in the USDW', and 'pH Plumes in the USDW'. 
# The CO2 released to the atmosphere is quantified with the 'CO2_atm' output from OpenWellbore1, 
# while the plume whiskers use the 'TDS_volume' and 'pH_volume' outputs from the FutureGen2Aquifer1 
# component. While leakage rates can increase and decrease over time, the probability shown 
# will reflect whether the leakage rates were ever greater than or equal to the threshold used 
# (1.0e-6 kg/s) during the entire simulation. Some risks cannot be quantified with NRAP-Open-IAM. 
# For example, there is currently no component in NRAP-Open-IAM that can quantify whether leakage 
# is likely to occur along the injector well itself. In this case, such a risk can be judged through 
# expert elicitation. The 'Contributors' whiskers include the risks 'Migration Along an MMV Well' and 
# 'Migration 'Along an Injector'. The 'ComponentNameList' entries for these risks are entered as 
# 'Expert Panel'. This indicates that the risk was evaluated with a qualitative, wholistic review 
# by a panel of experts. In this case, the site operators should present a panel of experts with 
# documents detailing the design and installation of the MMV and injection well, the planned 
# injection  operation, and the characteristics of the site. The documents should prove to the experts 
# that these wells do not represent a leakage risk. The 'Metrics' entry for the corresponding row 
# indicates the finding of the panel. The expected inputs for an expert panel review are 'Extremely Unlikely', 
# 'Unlikely', 'Inconclusive', 'Likely', or 'Extremely Likely'. For example, if the expert panel finds 
# that there is enough evidence to prove that that the wells will not serve as leakage pathways, then 
# the panel could return findings of 'Unlikely' or 'Extremely Unlikely'. Any text can be entered for 
# this field, however, and it will be displayed directly on the Bowtie figure as entered. Because 
# these risks have a qualitative review, the thresholds are entered as 'None'.
#
# The brine leakage risks considered here (OpenWellbore1) are significant, resulting in TDS plumes in 
# the aquifer considered (referred to as the USDW, underground source of drinking water). Because of 
# the high probability of impacts to the USDW, the Bowtie figure shows an expert judgement of 
# 'Loss of Project Support' as being 'Extremely Likely'. In this scenario, a legacy well like OpenWellbore1 
# should be sufficiently plugged and remediated before the planned injection operation can continue.
