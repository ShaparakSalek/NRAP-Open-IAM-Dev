# OpenIAM Control File Example 57a
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the TTFD Workflow. The TTFD Workflow 
# is meant to allow the use of the TTFD plot type without the need to 
# manually set up all of the components, component connections, and plot entries.
#
# The setup of this example is similar to Control File Example 40. Both that 
# example and this one use the FutureGen 2.0 data set to read reservoir conditions 
# through a LookupTableReservoir component. The pressures and CO2 saturations from 
# the reservoir component then drive leakage through MultisegmentedWellbore 
# components with the locations given under 'WellboreOptions: Locations'. The 
# CO2 and brine leakage rates into aquifer 1 ('AquiferName: aquifer1') then drive 
# the modeling of contaminant plumes in aquifer 1 by a FutureGen2AZMI component.
#
# The simulation uses Latin Hypercube Sampling ('Analysis: type: lhs') to stochastically 
# vary wellbore permeability (logWellPerm) across 30 realizations ('siz: 30').
# This example produces figures detailing the evolution of dissolved CO2 plumes 
# ('PlumeType: Dissolved_CO2') in aquifer 1. The TTFD plots also examine how monitoring 
# sensors at given locations can detect the dissolved CO2 plumes (input under 
# 'MonitoringLocations' - see the TTFD plot documentation, section 2.7.5). A plume 
# timing figure and monitoring TTFD figure are made for each realization. Additionally, 
# a figure is made showing the probability of dissolved CO2 plume occurrence. The 
# probability is calculated as the fraction of realizations in which a plume occurred 
# at each location. Because 'WriteDreamOutput: True' is entered under 'Options', 
# the TTFD plot will save .iam files containing the plume timings of each realization. 
# These .iam files can be used as input to the Design for Risk Evaluation and Management 
# (DREAM) program, which was developed by NRAP to optimize monitoring network design.
#
# Although this example does not use all of the optional entries for the TTFD plot type 
# (e.g., 'xGridSpacing', 'yGridSpacing', 'SpecifyXandYGridLims', 'NumZPointsWithinAquifers', 
# and 'NumZPointsWithinShales'), all of these entries can be given under 'Workflow: Options'.
#
# This example requires the additional FutureGen 2.0 data set.
# FutureGen 2.0 data set can be downloaded from the following source:
# https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/futuregen-2-0-1008-simulation-reservoir-lookup-table
#
# The downloaded data set should be placed here:
#     source/components/reservoir/lookuptables/FutureGen2/1008_sims
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex55a.yaml
