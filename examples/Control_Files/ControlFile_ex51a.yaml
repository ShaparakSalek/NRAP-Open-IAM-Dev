# OpenIAM Control File Example 51a
#
# This example illustrates a system model with an analytical reservoir component 
# providing pressure and CO2 saturation inputs for a Multisegmented Wellbore AI component. 
# The Multisegmented Wellbore AI component is a machine learning model with a robust 
# performance. It's conceptualization is similar to the Multisegmented Wellbore component, but 
# the Multisegmented Wellbore component is an analytical model.
#
# The 'useDLmodel' parameter controls whether the Multisegmented Wellbore AI component uses the 
# machine learning models. If useDLmodel is set to 1, the machine learning models are used for 
# Multisegmented Wellbore AI  results. If useDLmodel is set to 0, the results are based on 
# analytical modeling. In that case, the file from the first link shown below is still required, 
# as that file is used to calculate fluid properties. The file from the second link shown below 
# is not required when useDLmodel is 0.
#
# To run this example, the files for the Multisegmented Wellbore AI component must be 
# downloaded. The files are not included in the download of NRAP-Open-IAM because they are 
# large (about 2.3 GB). The two files can be downloaded from these links:
#     http://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/42fb2930-7bf5-48d9-821b-d801c6f29f36/resource/42882a99-a5b0-4d68-8f4c-cad4812358c4/download

#
# The zipped files must then be unzipped, with the resulting folders placed into this directory:
#     src/openiam/components/models/wellbore/multisegmented_ai
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#  python ../../src/openiam/components/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex51a.yaml
