This document provides guidance for the use of NRAP-Open-IAM. The document is quite large,
but each section is bookmarked. Utilizing these bookmarks will aid with the navigation
of this document.

The NRAP-Open-IAM has several ways for a user to build and run simulations, including 
a graphical user interface (GUI), text based control files (the control file interface, CFI),
and python scripts. The simplest way to build and run simulations for NRAP-Open-IAM is
the GUI. To launch the GUI, open a command prompt in the *source/GUI* directory and type::

    python NRAP_OPENIAM.py
